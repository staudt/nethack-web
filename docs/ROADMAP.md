# Roadmap

Goals beyond the current milestone. Milestone briefs live in `docs/kickoff-m*.md`.

## Mod platform

The two mod layers exist so that people can build on the game, and building should be easy *with an AI*:

- **Game-logic mods** in the style of Quake's `progs.dat`: different levels, custom monsters and objects, changed rules. They are game mods (`Mod` and `ModApi`): deterministic, recorded in saves.
- **Renderer plugins:** alternative ways to draw the `ViewSnapshot` (`Renderer`), plus client mods for input, menus and glyphs.
- **Selectable in the web app:** a picker at new game for the game mods, and a setting for the renderer, among the ones the app ships (and later, loaded from a URL or file).

It should stay simple: a mod is one module that registers defs. The work, planned for a milestone after more content exists (after 5b and probably shops or spells):

1. A mod authoring guide (`docs/MODDING.md`) that is complete enough for an AI to write a working mod from it alone, with every `define*` def, hook and helper documented, plus a worked example.
2. Two sample mods: a game mod (a custom level generator and a few monsters) and a renderer (for example the `render-canvas` sprite or UTF-8 stub).
3. The app's picker, and save/load that respects the chosen mod list (already enforced by `ModRef[]` in saves).
4. Loading a mod bundle at runtime (an ES module URL), with clear `ModLoadError`s.

Until then, every milestone keeps new core contracts small, data-driven and documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Vanilla stays an ordinary mod with no back doors.
